# Advent of Code

## About

**Welcome to my solutions for the Advent of Code!** I started in 2022 (this year), so any problems from before 2022 are just practice attempts.

> Want to give it a shot yourself? Go to [their website](https://adventofcode.com/) to participate in the current contest or try out the previous year's practice questions. Every year, AoC starts on December 1st, releasing new problems daily.

All my solutions are written in `Python`, but you may use any language you like.

## Nomenclature

There is a specific system that I use to name the files.

> This is me being extra!

* **Solutions:** "`[x]`.`[y]`.py"
  * `[x]` is a number representing the day.
  * `[y]` is a number representing the part, i.e. part 1 or 2.
* **Example Inputs:** "ex`[x]`.txt"
  * Example inputs that were used as tests.
  * `[x]` is a number representing the day that provided the example.
* **Inputs:** "p`[x]`.txt"
  * *The actual input that should be used to find the final answer.*
  * `[x]` is a number representing the day that provided the problem input.

## Known Issues / To Do

### 2021

* [ ] Day 1: When processing the input, the first couple hundred lines are skipped
